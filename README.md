# Lost-and-Found-Final

People often misplace their belongings and find things that aren't theirs all the time. Often times, people don't know what to do when they find missing items. Lost & Founds may not be present in the area you find a missing item, and if you lost an item, you may not know where to look. Having a simple way of connecting lost items with their respective owners is the main goal of this app. Our app Lost & Found poses a solution to this problem where users are able to give descriptive details of the item they lost, and people that have found the item would be able to get in direct contact with them. Lost & Found was developed by Vineeth Vemuri, Richard Chen, and Charlie Zhang.
